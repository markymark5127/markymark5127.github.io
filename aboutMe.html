      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>I'm Mark Mayne Jr., a full-stack software engineer with a passion for AI, creative tech, and making apps that solve real problems.</p>
      <p>I hail from Bel Air, Maryland, and studied Computer Science at York College of PA.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've worked with defense systems, real-time simulation, and cutting-edge AI tools to build everything from military software to iOS apps.</p>
      <p>These days, you’ll find me building tools like StyleSync AI and RecipeSnap AI — tech that blends utility with innovation.</p>
      <p>I believe in creative expression through code, and I treat every project like an artistic medium.</p>
